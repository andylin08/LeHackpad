# Macropad
---

## ðŸ§  Inspiration
This was my first time building a macropad, and I wanted to create something small and simple to use. Iâ€™ve always liked to play games, and I thought: why not make a compact little WASD/arrow keys?

## ðŸš§ Challenges
There were a lot of firsts in this project. It was my first time using Fusion 360 and KiCAD, and it took me a while to ship. But even with all the Googling and trial and error, Iâ€™m really proud of how it turned out. It wasnâ€™t perfect, but it was a huge learning experience that got me more comfortable with CAD and hardware design.
